A world engraved in darkness,
a bitch black cell which a little boy calls home,
or maybe even family, 
one day , 
a feather of light, 
a beacon of hope descended on him, 
making use of what's supposed to be his eyes,
he lifted his head to the weird sensation,
a loud snap echoed across the darkness,
blood came rushing into his hands,
they were almost glowing with every pump.
And without much more than seconds, 
his eyes reversed back to placeholders,
the light was gone, nothing but darkness remained,
but the boy was free, and he had a purpose, a wish,
to find that light, 
to find what could be a family for him although he knows nothing about that word,
yetâ€¦
